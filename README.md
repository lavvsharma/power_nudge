**PowerNudge** is a lightweight macOS utility that monitors your MacBook's battery percentage and sends you a **WhatsApp
alert via Twilio** when it reaches a predefined charging level â€” so you can unplug and prolong battery health.

Built with automation in mind, itâ€™s perfect for users who want a hands-free way to monitor charging without keeping an
eye on the battery all the time.

## ğŸš€ Features

* ğŸ”‹ Monitors battery percentage using macOS's `pmset` command
* ğŸ“¤ Sends a WhatsApp message via Twilio when a threshold is reached
* ğŸ§ª Built-in Twilio credential validation

## ğŸ›  Requirements

* Python 3.12+
* macOS (uses `pmset` for battery info)
* Twilio Account with WhatsApp sandbox enabled
* Internet connection to send WhatsApp message

## ğŸ“¦ Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install power_nudge
```

## ğŸ§  How It Works

Or, schedule it with a **cron job** or **launchd** to run periodically.
